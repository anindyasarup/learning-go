**Go Lang is a compiled language**

## Execution Speed

Interpreted Languages - JS, Python, Ruby, PHP
:   - In terms of execution speed, compiled languages are generally faster 
    than interpreted languages** like JS, Python, Ruby, and PHP. 'Go' is no 
    exception.
    - Overall, 'Go' is much faster than languages like 'JavaScript', 
    'Python', and 'Ruby' at executing programs.

Compiled Languages - Rust, C, C++, Java
:   - 'Go' code does not execute quite as fast as its compiled Rust and C 
    counterparts.
    - This lag can be attributed to its automated memory management also 
    known as the 'Go runtime'. 

## Compilation Speed

Compiled Languages - Rust, C, C++
:   - 'Go' code compiles much faster than compiled languages like Rust, C,
    C++. 
    - Considering it compiles much faster than other compiled languages, it 
    provides for a more productive developer experience.
